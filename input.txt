The VigenPlayCipher is a classical encryption scheme that combines the Playfair cipher and the Vigenere cipher to create a more secure encryption method. The Playfair cipher encrypts digraphs (pairs of letters), introducing diffusion, while the Vigenere cipher applies a repeating key to perform polyalphabetic substitution, adding confusion. The combination of these two ciphers increases the difficulty of cryptanalysis compared to using either cipher alone.
Breaking the VigenPlayCipher requires multiple stages of analysis. First, the Vigenere key length must be estimated using techniques such as the Kasiski examination and the Friedman test (index of coincidence). Frequency analysis per column is then applied to recover the Vigenere key. Once the Vigenere layer is decrypted, the intermediate ciphertext is decrypted using a hill-climbing approach to recover the Playfair key. Heuristic scoring functions based on common English trigrams and short words are used to evaluate candidate plaintexts and keys.
This project implements a Python-based automated breaker for the VigenPlayCipher, capable of attempting to recover both the Vigenere and Playfair keys from ciphertext. Special considerations, such as padding odd-length Playfair ciphertexts, are included to prevent decryption errors. The automated approach combines classical cryptanalysis methods with heuristic search techniques to provide the most likely plaintext and key candidate
